# WKWebView Example App

This is an example of how to implement a WKWebView using Swift without the need of a storyboard. This example was inspired by the Medium [post](https://medium.com/better-programming/create-a-wkwebview-programmatically-in-swift-5-fc08c8ad8708) by Zafar Ivaev.

I have included delegate examples from the WKNavigationDelegate along with an example of how to use the WKURLSchemeHandler.
